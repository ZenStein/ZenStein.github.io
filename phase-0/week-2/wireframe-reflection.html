<h2>What is a wireframe?</h2>
<p>
    A wireframe is a basic bare bones blueprint or map of what you plan on creating.
</p>
<h2>What are the benefits of wireframing?</h2>
<p>
    Gives a foundation and can be used as a general guide when you first start building.
    It is necessary to make a plan before you start creating any code, this will lessen the
    chance of creating something that won't work, and/or something that leads to a dead end.
    Coding without any pre planning is like driving blindfolded, you need to have a well thought
    out map to guide you and keep you thinking ahead. That's what wireframing can do.

</p>
<h2>Did you enjoy wireframing your site?</h2>
<p>
    Yes, I love visualizing and imagining possibilities. It's also challenging when you really sit
    down and think about how things are going to work.
</p>
<h2>Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?</h2>
<p>
    I changed my ideas a few times, mainly just getting rid of things that weren't necessary.
</p>
<h2>What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?</h2>
<p>
    I needed clarification on border-box vs content-box.  CSS tricks came in quite helpful!  I also spent
    far too much time messing around with SVG's.  I finally have an understanding of the different
    ways to imbed, and they ++ and -- of the different ways.
</p>
<h2>Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?</h2>
<p>
    The same thing I enjoyed was at times tedious. I was starting to get frustrated when I coudn't get
    the SVG to load the way I wanted it to.  It turns out, once an inline ' style"" ' rule has been applied
    to a SVG element, no other rules will affect it.  It's always something so simple, yet so hard!
