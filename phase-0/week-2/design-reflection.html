<h2>What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?</h2>
<p>My site will have two main goals. One will be to showcase my skills, and Give potential
employers the chance to get a feel for who I am, and see what skills I can bring to the table.
My second goal will be aimed at helping other coders get the answers they are looking for.
I hope to keep a good record of problems I've encountered and solved.  Hopefully facilitating
other process as they jump throught the same hurdles
</p>

<h2>What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?</h2>
<p>
    Mainly going to be Late/Middle aged males.  Seeing as how I am almost that, I going to speak from the heart,
    and be continually updating my content.
</p>

<h2>What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? <br>
    Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? <br>
    It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.</h2>
<p>
    I see most of my visiters going on there in order to look up info. Either it be one of my blogs,
    or someone interested in seeing what I can produce.
</p>

<h2>What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?</h2>
<p>
    From my personal experience, it needs to be intuitive, and people should be able to go on there
    and accomplish whatever it is with out needing to invest too much time in understanding how everything
    works.  It also needs to look good on the eyes, not take too long to load, and it needs to be responsive.
</p>

<h2>What is user experience design and why is it valuable?</h2>
<p>
    User experience will make or break your app.  If people in general are not happy after leaving
    your site, then you are not going to be successful in this business.  The hardest part to all this
    is making something that anyone can use, not just computer guys who have thousands of hours
    invested
</p>
<h2>Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?</h2>
<p>
    I've never been a fan on reading up on how to do things. I like to dive in.  Once I am faced with challenges
    I then can see why things are relevant and what not. Reading up on theory is hard to stay focused.
