##How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?##

Yes you can, you can pull up the inspector by right clicking, inspect element.

##How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?##

Of course, that is what CSS is used for.

##What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?##

**absolute**  - element will be default to top right corner of browser window, and other elements will not
affect its position.

**fixed** - element will stay put, even if you scroll, the element wont move with screen
**static** - default element position, it comes in relational to where it was created, cannot
be moved using CSS position
**relative** - elements will come in, in relation to other elements.

##What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?##

**margin** is the space outside of the element itself. Good for keeping space between different elements
**border** border is the outline of the element, depending on the box-sizing property of the
element, it can either add to the height and width, be included.
**padding** - padd creates space between the outline of the element, and and its child elements

##What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)##
I enjoy CSS (except when I can't get it to do what I want!).  I feel there still are a lot of things
that can be improved in the way we write CSS. Flexbox has made
some great progress in this area. I'm looking forward to the future, and am interested in getting
to know CSS on a deeper level.
