<h1>What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?</h1>
    <p> mainly the div tag I've been working with. Trying to get the bare bones
    structure of my website going.</p>
<h1>How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?</h1>
    <p>All elements are connected to the DOM, and it constructed like a huge tree. elements
    can have parents, children, and siblings. Think of it like a family tree.</p>
<h1>What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?</h1>
        <p>I have been familiar with sublime, and have been using snippets regularly. Currently I have been
        working on my terminal aliases for all the git commands.</p>
