# Class Warfare, Validate a Credit Card Number


# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].
# I spent [#] hours on this challenge.

# Pseudocode

# Input: a 16 digit number
# Output: true or false, whether or not the number is valid
# Steps: Make sure the number is 16 digits, if it is, accept the new object.
#        Next double every even index'd value. Then add every single digit
#        together, where 16 is 1 + 6. Return true or false if the sum is a
#        multiple of 10.


# Initial Solution

# Don't forget to check on initialization for a card length
# of exactly 16 digits

        Reflection

What was the most difficult part of this challenge for you and your pair?
  Keeping track of whether or not the values were of type string or int.
What new methods did you find to help you when you refactored?
  The .each_with_index saved us from having to manually keep track of the index.
What concepts or learnings were you able to solidify in this challenge?
  Getting a grasp on what type of var you are working with.  Training my mind
  to take that into account. Coming off Javascript, it wasn't necessary.
  I now need to 'retrain' my mind to take into the var type into account.
