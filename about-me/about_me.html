        I grew up in Big Bear Lake, CA. It's a small resort town
        About 2 hours out of LA, up in the mountains of San Bernardino.
        It's a small town of 10,000 but in the busy times, it swells to 100,000
        There is a ski resort in the winter and a lake to enjoy in the summer.
        Life sure is different out there compared to San Francisco.

    <div class="blog-body-desc">Quirk:</div>
    <div class="blog-body">
        For the most part I'm an easy going guy. My one main quirk
        involves my kitchen. The day I get married, I will make sure
        to have built a house where I can have my own personal kitchen.
        I am sure that the little black dots on the pans cause cancer.
        I have developed my own personal way to cook, no one wants to follow
        it, SO GET OUT!!!
        Other than that, we're all good in the hood.
