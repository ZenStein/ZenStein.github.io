**What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?**
My biggest lesson was learnng about the box sizing property.  This property clarifys
wheather or not the border attribute will add to the overall size of the div, or
be included in the specified height and width.  I wrongfully assumed that it would
be included, as I feel this way is more intuitive. To my surprise, I found that this
was the standard convention for IE and NOT chrome, safari... etc. For the first time I
find myself agreeing with IE???? That's crazy! lol.

**What did you learn about CSS positioning?**
One thing I learned about positioning is the advantages of using 'container divs'
I like using a specified container, then have it's children layed out relatively, using percentage.
Having set width/height elements whos parent width/height is percentage will lead to problems.

**What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?**
Easy - NOTHING!
Most difficult was working with SVG's. They are really cool, yet really difficult to
grasp. Getting them to import and being able to use CSS on them and all the technical
rules was quite overwhelming. I stuck with it though as I see the value that comes
from working with SVG's. Without them, we wouldn't be able to have things like
google maps!

**What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?**
I learned many different things, as well as refreshed my memory on some thins. working with SVG's
and being able to create them with AI and manipulate them with CSS is what I learned through this excercise.
