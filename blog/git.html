    <h6>What are the benefits of version control?</h6>
<p>Version control has many benefits. It allows for teams of coders to collaborate efficiently. It enables you to ’tinker’ with your code without the fear of breaking it. It allows your code to go back if any unforeseen issues arise.  It also helps everyone keep track of the changes, as the code evolves.  </p>
    <h6>How does git help you keep track of changes?</h6>
<p>git was designed from its core to be used as a tool for anyone working on a project.  As you work, with a few easy commands, you keep track and record of what your code looked like at any given time.  </p>
    <h6>Why use GitHub to store your code?</h6>
<p>Storing anything in the cloud has proved quite convenient.  You no longer are burdened with syncing all your devices, and better yet, you no longer have to manually keep you and all your co-workers in sync.  Storing your code on Github allows you access your code from anywhere there is an internet connection.  It is also nice to be able to view your team mates work in live time, so you can know where everyone is instantly. </p>

        I like real world examples to help me learn. Let's say you are a programmer and your boss just gave you a
      to-do list of 100 numbered tasks. All the tasks pertain to altering code that the company has developed. You start at 1) fix misspelling here 2) change background color there ... and
      so on. After each completed task, you diligently save your work as you go.
      Two weeks later, just before your almost done, the boss comes in and says he changed his mind, he
      wants everything back the way it was. Going back is now going to take a lot of effort, if only you had made a copy of the code
      before you started.  That's where a commit comes in.  Think of a commit as the old school 'save as'. After you finished task 1,
      you save it as 'task_1_complete', then after the second task is complete, you save as 'task_2_complete'. So a few months goes by,
      and your boss has changed his mind again.  He actually wants to implement tasks 25-50. 'No sweat you say'
      as you had learned from your previous mistake, and you committed after every task! There is only one problem,
      'task_50_complete' has saved ALL tasks 1-50, your boss only wants tasks 25-50 implemented. The 'save as' strategy of committing as you
      go was undoubtedly better then just saving, but how can we get even more flexible? This is where branching and merging come into play.
      Lets say when your boss first handed you the list of 100 tasks, you went and made 100 duplicates of your code. You named each duplicate
      task_1 through task_100 respectively. You now have 100 new branches, or duplicates, or copies. You now go to branch named 'task_1', and
      finish task 1, and only task one. Then you go to task_2, and continue the process. Now the boss has the flexibility
      to pick and chose any of the tasks he wishes to implement. All you have to do is merge the ones he likes!


  </p>

      That is an oversimplified version, but hopefully it will help someone get a grasp of some of the terms.
      A branch is a copy or a duplicate, and a commit is a 'save as'.  Please note that a commit doesn't actually
      save a whole new copy like 'save as' normally would. Nor does making a branch actually duplicate all your code.
      How git actually works is quite fascinating and ingenious.
