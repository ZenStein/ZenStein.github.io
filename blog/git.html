    <h6>What are the benefits of version control?</h6>
<p>VVersion control has many benefits. It allows for teams of coders to collaborate efficiently. It enables you to ’tinker’ with your code without the fear of breaking it. It allows your code to go back if any unforeseen issues arise.  It also helps everyone keep track of the changes, as the code evolves.  </p>
    <h6>How does git help you keep track of changes?</h6>
<p>git was designed from its core to be used as a tool for anyone working on a project.  As you work, with a few easy commands, you keep track and record of what your code looked like at any given time.  </p>
    <h6>Why use GitHub to store your code?</h6>
<p>Storing anything in the cloud has proved quite convenient.  You no longer are burdened with syncing all your devices, and better yet, you no longer have to manually keep you and all your co-workers in sync.  Storing your code on Github allows you access your code from anywhere there is an internet connection.  It is also nice to be able to view your team mates work in live time, so you can know where everyone is instantly. </p>
